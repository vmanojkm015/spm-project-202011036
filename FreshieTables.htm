<p>Welcome, new student! You've exerted your mind hard to reach your goal, now that you've reached it it probably deserves a rest. Which is certainly not going to happen if the academic office throws indecipherable math puzzles such as <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/TimeTableAutumnSem20141July.pdf">this time table</a><sup>1</sup> at you.</p>

<p>Do not despair! We've gone through similar turmoil as you, and feel that such torture should have been banned by the Geneva Convention. Which is why I've prepared these time tables below:</p>

<p>These time tables can be edited, re-shared, and printed, so you can tweak them as certain bits of your schedule become clearer.</p>

<p>Are you finding these time tables indecipherable too<sup>2</sup>? Here's some more information on the codes used in them:</p>

<p>While each time table may show three lab slots (the three hour slots) booked, each individual student will only have two labs a week. You will have only two of the four (PH 117, CH 117, ME 113, ME 119) lab courses in a sem. For each lab, you will have a lab division (P1, P2, P3, etc), and your timings for the lab / lab lecture depend on this as shown in the time table. For the first week or two, you may not know your lab division. This is okay, they get released a bit late. However, don't expect them to come out online. When it comes to labs, most of the instructors prefer to use decrepit notice boards somewhere in their department rather than email everyone<sup>3</sup>, because of course email is way too mainstream.</p>

<p>The correct way to handle this is to try to keep in touch with the prof, and regularly have someone visit the lab venues. Once you know your batch, you can go ahead and edit the time table provided to you above (removing the unnecessary stuff), and print it. There's also a CS lab and an associated timing, but you'll be told about this in class.</p>

<p>Another common issue is with the venues. LCH, LHC, L3, LCT, LCC, ... where L stands for Lost, because that's what this naming system does to everyone. <br>
So there are two Lecture Hall Complexes (LHCs), large, colorful buildings which you will learn to associate with naptime. One of them is officially <i>the</i> Lecture Hall Complex, but there is much disagreement on which one it is (so be careful with this name). They're much better identified by the rooms that they contain.
<ul>
<li>L3, or the "New Lecture Hall Complex", contains Hall 1 through Hall 4 (Now known as LA 101, LA 102, LA 301, LA 302). These are large auditoriums, which pay great justice to the theatrics of the various professors who perform in them. Oh, you want coordinates that you can feed to your GPS? <i>sigh</i>. <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Lecture+Hall+Complex/@19.1306286,72.9169173,185m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x3be7c7f43c441125:0x1c82362bb361e58b">Here you go</a>. Kids these days. We used to walk to lectures with only the starts to guide us and it was <i>uphill both ways</i><sup>4</sup></li>
<li>The old "Lecture Hall Complex", contains LH, LC, and LT. Remember these as Lecture Hall, Lecture Classroom, and Lecture Tutorialroom. LHes are large auditoriums (not as large as the Halls); LCs are, well, classroom-sized; and LTs are very tiny (your tutorials will happen here). I haven't mentioned <i>which</i> tutorial room you have to use in the time table since this is announced later (thankfully, online). <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Lecture+Hall+Complex/@19.1307656,72.9166668,185m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3be7c7f420dd7941:0x34f8dc9cc70dea5">Maps link</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>That probably should be enough to get you started. If you need further help, just ask your mentor. Have fun!</p>

<sup>1. Incidentally, it is believed that the IIT Bombay academic calendar was the inspiration for the Mayan calendar many ages ago. The artisans who carved the calendar were so horrified by the abomination unfolding before them that they were unable to continue past 2012, instead preferring to take their own lives. We can only hope that the same happens with the academic calendar, however these are stolid men who eat DACs and FRs for breakfast. We cannot expect them to be so easily moved.</sup><br><br>
